# C Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository is designed for practicing **basic operations on data structures and algorithms** in **C**. Each week's exercises are organized into separate folders, and students are expected to collaborate in teams using **branch-based development**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```

## 📌 Collaboration Workflow

Students will work in **teams**, and each team should create new branches for their solutions. Follow these steps to contribute effectively:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```
2. **Create a new branch for your team’s work**
    ```sh
    git checkout -b team-name/week-02/operations-with-numbers
    ```
3. **Work on the exercises within the assigned week’s folder**
4. **Commit changes regularly**
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added solution for week-02 operations-with-numbers"
    ```
5. **Push the branch to the repository**
    ```sh
    git push origin team-name/week-02/operations-with-numbers
    ```
6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR) for review**

## 🚀 Development Notes

- Each team should **create a separate branch** for each week's exercises.
- Use **clear and meaningful commit messages**.
- Ensure that the code is **well-structured and properly commented**.
- Follow best practices for **C programming** and **data structure implementations**.

## 🏆 Goal

The goal of this repository is to **enhance problem-solving skills** and **collaborative coding experience** while working with fundamental **data structures and algorithms** in **C**.
